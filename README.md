# Polymer Hacker News

A [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) powered implementation of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).
Built with [polymer-cli](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) and uses the
[Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli@next

### Install dependencies

    npm install

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:8081` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    npm start

### Build

The `npm run build` command builds your Polymer application for production, using build configuration options provided by the command line or in your project's `polymer.json` file.

You can configure your `polymer.json` file to create multiple builds. This is necessary if you will be serving different builds optimized for different browsers. You can define your own named builds, or use presets. See the documentation on [building your project for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/toolbox/build-for-production) for more information.

The Polymer Starter Kit is configured to create three builds. These builds will be output to a subdirectory under the `build/` directory as follows:

```
build/
  es5-bundled/
  es6-bundled/
  esm-bundled/
```

* `es5-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is compiled to ES5 for compatibility with older browsers.
* `es6-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is served as-is. This build is for browsers that can handle ES6 code - see [building your project for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/toolbox/build-for-production#compiling) for a list.
* `esm-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. It uses standard ES module import/export statements for browsers that support them.

Run `polymer help build` for the full list of available options and optimizations. Also, see the documentation on the [polymer.json specification](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-json) and [building your Polymer application for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/toolbox/build-for-production).

### Preview the build

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`
in an unbundled state, as it would be served by a push-compatible server:

    polymer serve build/unbundled

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`
generated using fragment bundling:

    polymer serve build/bundled

### Run tests

This command will run
[Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) against the
browsers currently installed on your machine.

    polymer test
